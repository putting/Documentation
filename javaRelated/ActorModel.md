- Why Actor-based systems are one of the foundational technologies for creating microservices architecture (MSA).
- How Actors delegate work by creating other Actors in a supervisor-to-worker relationship.
- How Actors manage requests and scale horizontally in large systems.
- The difference between traditional systems and actor-based systems.
- How an Actor system forms clusters when the flow of work exceeds a systemâ€™s capacity to process it.
- Why failure detection and failure recovery is an architectural feature of Actor systems.
- An example of using Actors to build an Internet of Things (IoT) application.
