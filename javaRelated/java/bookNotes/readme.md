# Summary of Books


Book Title | Rating (10) | Description
---------- | ----------- | -------------
Functional Prog in Java by  Venkat Subramaniam 2014 | 8 | Overall I thought a v good book. Especially the later chapters which illustrate some good practices with complex egs. Some re-reading required. Good that it focusses on lambdas and not too much on Concurrency etc..
Java 8 Lambdas by Richard Warburton 2014 | 8 | Good Concurrency & non-blocking, plus demonstrates Patterns. Uses Artists Beatles etc. as egs.
Java 8 in Action by Raoul-Gabriel Urma 2014 | 0 | TODO
