# Summary of Books


Book Title | Rating (10) | Description
---------- | ----------- | -------------
Functional Prog in Java by  Venkat Subramaniam 2014 | 8 | Overall I thought a v good book. Especially the later chapters which illustrate some good practices with complex egs. Some re-reading required. Good that it focusses on lambdas and not too much on Concurrency etc..
Java 8 Lambdas by Richard Warburton 2014 | 8 | Good Concurrency & non-blocking, plus demonstrates Patterns. Uses Artists Beatles etc. as egs.
Java 8 in Action by Raoul-Gabriel Urma 2014 | 8 | Overall v good book. Re-read the notes here as a good reminder of all the chapters, esp principles and ideas. Also See LazyLists p398 impl for some v interesting coding approaches Using Lazy Supplier : () -> from(n+1) where n also passed into method. 
Core Java, Volume II-Fundamentals by | 0 | TODO: 100 pages. Bit old and basic, but maybe read Ch6 lambdas & Ch14 Concurrency
Core Java, Volume II-Advanced Features 2 by  - Cay S. Horstmann | 0 | TODO: 2000 pages! I guess v in-depth. There are some advanced topics but I think use as a reference if I need to. Maybe read ch1 on streams.
