Good summary doc of this approach.

[link](http://carfield.com.hk/document/software%2Bdesign/dddquickly.pdf)

Follows a lot of what I did at M&G and states the main principles succinctly

p52 includes a discussion on Aggregates – which ties a few entities (and value objs) together for updates where ONLY the root entity can be changed fromn outside of the boundary (M&G discussions)
